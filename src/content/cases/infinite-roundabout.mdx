Designed to improve traffic flow, the **Swindon Seaside Node** is a "turbo-roundabout" consisting of <RedactedText text="five mini-roundabouts" /> arranged in a larger circle. The mathematical model used to design it was theoretically sound, assuming all drivers are physicists with a degree in fluid dynamics.

In practice, the roundabout acts as a particle accelerator for family sedans. Local residents report entering the roundabout to go to the post office and ending up in a <RedactedText text="neighboring county" /> due to centrifugal force.

A study conducted by the Department of Motion revealed that the average driver spends 14 minutes orbiting the center island, often weeping. The city has since installed a <RedactedText text="grief counselor kiosk" /> at the third exit, which is the most profitable business in the district.
