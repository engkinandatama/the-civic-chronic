The **Paperless Bureaucracy Initiative** was launched with the noble goal of modernizing government records and saving an estimated 50,000 trees annually. The premise was simple: digitize all incoming forms and destroy the originals securely.

Irony struck swiftly. To ensure the accuracy of the digitization process, a protocol was introduced requiring every digital scan to be printed for manual verification and signed in triplicate. This resulted in a **400% increase** in paper consumption during the initiative's lifespan. Storage facilities for the "temporary" verification copies soon overflowed, necessitating the rental of additional warehouse space at premium commercial rates.

A freelance consultant eventually pointed out that the digital forms were non-searchable PDFs, essentially making them pictures of text rather than data. The project was quietly shuttered, and the printers remain in use.
