The **Bench of Solitude** stands as a testament to design prioritizing form over function. Part of the "New Urban Zen" revitalization project, these monolithic concrete seating arrangements were intended to foster quiet contemplation in the bustling city center.

Critically, the design team failed to account for the thermal retention properties of dark grey concrete in direct sunlight. During the summer heatwave of 2021, the benches reached surface temperatures capable of frying an egg—or scorching the skin of weary pedestrians. Within weeks of opening, emergency services responded to multiple minor burn incidents.

Rather than removing or shading the benches (deemed "aesthetically compromising"), the city opted to install permanent chain-link fencing around the seating area. The benches are now strictly for viewing purposes only, offering solitude by ensuring no one can ever sit on them.
