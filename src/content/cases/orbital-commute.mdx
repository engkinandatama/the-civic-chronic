The **Circle City Metro Line** was designed to revolutionize transit. And it technically did, in that it revolves perfectly around the city center without ever actually stopping *in* the city center.

Due to a failure to acquire land rights for the downtown hub, the central station was scrapped. The resulting track is a perfect closed loop. Commuters can board the train at any of the 4 suburban stations, enjoy a scenic 45-minute tour of industrial backlots, and disembark exactly where they started.

The Transit Authority has rebranded the failure as a "<RedactedText text="Meditative Journey Experience" />." It is currently the most popular place for napping in the state.
