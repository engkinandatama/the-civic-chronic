In an effort to modernize operations and reduce environmental impact, the **Department of Efficiency** launched the "Green Streamline" initiative. The goal was simple: eliminate physical paper trails by digitizing all inter-departmental memos.

Irony struck immediately. To "ensure secure transition," protocol dictated that every digital document be printed in triplicate for <RedactedText text="hard-copy verification" />. Furthermore, to access the new digital portal, employees were required to fill out physical access request forms, scan them, print the confirmation email, and mail it to IT support.

By the end of the fiscal year, the department had consumed an entire forest's worth of paper solely to document the process of going paperless. The initiative was quietly scrapped, and the memo announcing its cancellation was distributed via <RedactedText text="fax" />.
