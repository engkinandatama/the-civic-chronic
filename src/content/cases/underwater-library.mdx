The **Floodplain Valley Public Library** was an architectural triumph, featuring a sunken reading room designed to be "at eye level with nature." Unfortunately, nature decided to come inside.

Built 10 feet below the 100-year flood line, the library floods approximately every <RedactedText text="Tuesday" />. The "Rare Books Section" is now an aquarium housing several confused catfish and a soggy copy of *Moby Dick*.

Management has refused to relocate, instead requesting an additional grant for <RedactedText text="snorkel gear" /> for all staff members. The Return Drop Box is currently accessible only by canoe.
