The **East Hamington Suspension Bridge** is a marvel of modern engineering. It features high-tensile steel cables, a vibration-dampening deck, and solar-powered LED lighting. It is, by all accounts, a perfect bridge, with one minor flaw: it crosses a <RedactedText text="dry ravine" /> and terminates directly into the side of a granite cliff face.

Original plans called for the bridge to span the *West* Hamington River, connecting the residential district to the commercial hub. However, due to a "clerical error" involving a <RedactedText text="coffee stain" /> on the master blueprint, the construction site was shifted 3 miles north.

Contractors noticed the error on day 3 but were told by the Department of Zoning that "stopping now would require a <RedactedText text="Form 88-B" />, which takes 6 months to process." Construction proceeded on schedule. The bridge now serves as the world's most expensive picnic spot and is currently inhabited by a family of bobcats who refuse to pay the toll.
