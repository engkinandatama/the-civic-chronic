The **National Permit Simplification Portal (NPSP)** was created to replace the agonizing process of mailing in paper forms. It succeeded in replacing paper cuts with carpal tunnel syndrome.

The system features a state-of-the-art "Virtual Waiting Room" that simulates the experience of standing at the DMV, complete with a digital avatar of a clerk who <RedactedText text="ignores you to play Solitaire" />.

Due to a coding error in the timestamp validation logic (`if (year > 2000) return error;`), the system rejects any application from the 21st century. Tech support consists of a chatbot named "Gary" whose only response is "<RedactedText text="Have you tried turning the government off and on again?" />"
