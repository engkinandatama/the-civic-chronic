The **Phoenix Rapid Transit Expansion** aimed to bring eco-friendly travel to the desert. The city purchased a fleet of "Prototype" electric buses that were surprisingly affordable.

The buses featured a unique design flaw: the cooling vents for the lithium batteries were located directly above the asphalt, sucking in <RedactedText text="160Â°F radiated heat" /> from the road. This effectively turned the battery packs into convection ovens.

During the first week of service, the buses didn't just break down; they achieved rapid thermal disassembly. The Department of Transport has since rebranded them as "<RedactedText text="External Combustion Engines" />."
