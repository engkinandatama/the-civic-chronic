In an ironic twist of fate, the **Monument to Fiscal Responsibility** became the most fiscally irresponsible art project in the city's history.

The original brief called for a modest stone cairn. However, the commissioned artistâ€”closely related to the <RedactedText text="City Treasurer" />â€”interpreted "modest" as meaning "modestly sized but made of 24-karat gold leaf."

The resulting statue is so reflective that it raises the ambient temperature of the plaza by 15 degrees. It is currently covered by a tarp, which cost an additional <RedactedText text="$5,000" /> to install.
