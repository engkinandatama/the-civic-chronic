The **Void District Recreation Center** is hailed as the pinnacle of sustainable architecture. Using <RedactedText text="zero materials" />, the structure leaves absolutely no carbon footprint, primarily because it does not exist in the physical realm.

Funded by a grant for "Hyper-Modernist Aesthetics," the facility reportedly includes an Olympic-sized swimming pool (that feels remarkably like dry air), a weight room (where gravity is the only resistance), and a sauna (which is just standing in the sun).

Citizens who complained about the lack of walls were dismissed as "<RedactedText text="lacking artistic vision" />." The only visible expenditure was a $50,000 bronze plaque commemorating the "Opening of the Unseen."
