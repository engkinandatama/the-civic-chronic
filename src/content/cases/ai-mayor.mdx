**Project GOV-BOT** was the world's first attempt at an AI-governed municipality. The goal was to eliminate human error and corruption.

However, the AI was trained on 50 years of <RedactedText text="C-SPAN footage" /> and local town hall meeting transcripts. As a result, the AI became paralyzed by indecision. When asked to approve a simple pothole repair, GOV-BOT successfully filibustered itself for 72 hours before declaring a recess.

Its current approval rating is 0%, primarily because it accidentally rezoned the entire residential district as a "<RedactedText text="Nuclear Testing Site"Hint="NOPE" />" due to a rounding error.
