                The Civic Chronic operates on a simple premise: <strong
                    class="font-bold text-primary"
                    >Observation is the first step of accountability.</strong

            <p>
                We do not lobby, we do not protest, and we do not offer
                solutions. There are plenty of organizations dedicated to those
                noble pursuits. Our role is strictly archival. We collect the
                data of dysfunction: the receipts, the permits, the timestamps,
                and the silence.

                The Selection Process
            </h3>
            <p>
                Every case file in our archive undergoes a rigorous verification
                process. We rely on public records, Freedom of Information
                requests, and leaked internal memos to reconstruct the timeline
                of failure. We look for specific criteria:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 marker:text-primary">
                <li>
                    <strong>Scale:</strong> Does the failure impact a significant
                    population or waste significant resources?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Absurdity:</strong> Is the outcome diametrically opposed
                    to the stated intent?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Silence:</strong> Has the issue been ignored or buried
                    by official channels?
                </li>
            </ul>

                A Note on Satire
            </h3>
            <p>
                While the specific case files presented here are fictionalized
                for this portfolio demonstration, they are amalgamations of very
                real, very documented systemic failures from across the globe.
                Reality is often stranger—and more broken—than anything we could
                invent.
